	<!-- *** IMPORTANT **
	This index.html file is designed to be used only if you do not want to use create-elm-app for some reason. 
	You will need to comment out the 'import' statements at the top of src/index.js
	There will likely be some issues with the client-side routing in using other HTTP servers.
	I would highly recommend using create-elm-app to avoid these potential issues, unless you are very familiar with SPA and handling redirection and routing URLs with subpaths.

	If you use create-elm-app, you can safely delete this file.
